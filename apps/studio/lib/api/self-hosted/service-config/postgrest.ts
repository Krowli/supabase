 * PostgREST's in-database configuration: settings on the `authenticator` role, which override the
 * container env the service was started with. Reading them back is how Studio can answer with what
 * PostgREST is running on rather than with what the compose file once said.
 *
 * `setconfig` is a `text[]` of `name=value`, one array per (role, database) pair. A role can be
 * configured globally (`setdatabase = 0`) and again for one database, and the database-scoped row is
 * the one that applies where both exist. Both rows are read and the scoped one wins, so what Studio
 * answers with is what PostgREST resolves on the database it is connected to. Rows for any *other*
 * database are excluded in SQL — they describe a connection this stack does not make.
 *
 * The three settings this module writes are in-database settings and reload without a restart:
 * `db-schemas`, `db-extra-search-path` and `db-max-rows`. **`db-pool` and
 * `db-pool-acquisition-timeout` are neither** — the PostgREST 14 reference gives both "In-Database:
 * n/a" and "Reloadable: N", so a `pgrst.db_pool` on the role would be a GUC nothing reads, and the
 * pool size can only be changed by the container's `PGRST_DB_POOL` plus a restart. Rather than
 * store a number that would read back as if it had taken effect, this module never writes either
 * one and answers `null` for both. The UI keeps the field read-only self-hosted and says where the
 * real value lives.
 * See https://docs.postgrest.org/en/v14/references/configuration.html#db-pool.
