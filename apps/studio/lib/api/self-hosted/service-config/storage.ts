/**
 * The Storage settings: remembered here, rendered into an env file, applied by a restart.
 *
 * This is the one settings page in this stage whose service cannot be told anything at run time.
 * storage-api reads `UPLOAD_FILE_SIZE_LIMIT`, `ENABLE_IMAGE_TRANSFORMATION`, `S3_PROTOCOL_ENABLED`
 * and the S3 protocol key pair once, at process start, and has no admin API and no config table
 * behind them. So a save writes `storage.env` into `STORAGE_CONFIG_DIR` — a host directory
 * bind-mounted into both containers — and the operator restarts the storage service, whose `command`
 * sources that file before it execs the server. The page says so, in an admonition, above the form.
 *
 * Because of that, Studio's own record is the only thing that can answer a read: the file it wrote
 * is not the config storage-api is running, and will not be until the restart. Reads therefore come
 * from `storage-config.json`, falling back per field to the same env names mirrored into Studio's
 * container, which is what a stack that has never been touched from the UI is running.
 *
 * Verified against supabase/storage 1.44.2: `src/config.ts` (`getConfig`, which reads every name
 * below once at import), `src/http/routes/s3/index.ts` and `src/storage/protocols/s3/`.
